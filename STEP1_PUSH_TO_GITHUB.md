## 📋 Instructions

### 1.1 Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open [github.com](https://github.com) in your browser
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
   - Click **"New repository"**
4. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `inkline-printing-system`
   - **Description**: `InkLine Smart Printing Queue System for DVC` (optional)
   - **Visibility**: 
     - Choose **Private** (recommended - only you can see it)
     - Or **Public** (anyone can see it)
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: DO NOT check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - DO NOT add .gitignore or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### 1.2 Get Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. You'll see a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkline-printing-system.git
```

**Save your GitHub username** - you'll need it for the next step!

### 1.3 Push Your Code
